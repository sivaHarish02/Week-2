# Functions - Step1

## Functions
A `function` is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single action. Functions repeat tasks that involve a similar sequence of steps. You have already seen the `console.log()` function, which allows you to predictably log some output to the console.

Look at this example of a function definition that returns the product of two numbers:
```
function multiply(n1, n2) {
  return n1 * n2;
}
 
//To make this function run, you need to call it like this:
multiply(3, 15);
```
This is called a function declaration. You start by creating a function name, which you then define as a function by using the `function(){}` syntax. Functions can have optional inputs like `3` and `5` in the example above. These are called `parameters`.

Within the parentheses are a set of arguments, which are values that are used or manipulated by the function in some way. If you have multiple arguments, they are each separated by a comma. A function can also have no arguments.

The code to be executed by the function goes within the curly braces {}. If you expect the function to give back some value, it should include a `return` statement, which is done by using the keyword `return`, followed by the value you want to be returned. If you donâ€™t expect your JavaScript function to return a value, you do not have to include a return statement. In this case the function returns undefined.

In order to make use of a function, you must invoke or call it.

In the example above, the function is called like this:
```
multiply(3, 15);
```
You can also write a function expression where you assign the returned value of the function to a variable. That variable can even be passed into another function as an argument, so you can reuse that logic. This is called a callback function, and you will learn more about that later.
```
var timesTen = function (x) {
  return x * 10;
};
 
console.log(timesTen(5));
```
## Why are Functions Important?
The most important reason to use functions is that they allow you to reuse code and create modules to perform procedures you plan on using repeatedly. A good practice is to make the function do one task and one task only.

## Task Instruction
You task in this activity is to complete the implementation of the function `add`. This function needs to do the following:

- It takes two parameters x and y
- It returns the sum of the two parameters x and y.

Note: _You can calculate the sum of two numbers simply adding them: x + y_

## Task

- Write a function that adds 2 numbers.

## Functions - Step 2

## Functions Practice
Now try writing a function that welcomes a friend.

To complete this task, you will need to implement the `greet()` function. This function needs to have a parameter called `name` and return a message that welcomes the person with that name.

For example, if you call the function as follow: `greet("Dani")`, the result should be: "Hello Dani" or "Greetings Dani'

Your code should be added to the `greet.js` file inside the `functions-02` folder.

### Task

- Create a function call greet() with one parameter `name` which returns a string that welcomes the name passed in.

## Functions - Step 3

### Functions
### `typeof` Method
`typeof` returns a string indicating the data type of the parameter being evaluated, as you can see in the examples below:
```
let number_of_transactions = 970
console.log(typeof(number_of_transactions))
//expected result: number
 
console.log(typeof("The ceremony is scheduled at 8am."))
//string
 
console.log(typeof(true))
//boolean
 
console.log(typeof(sept_record))
//undefined
```
### Strict Equality Comparison - The Concept of Triple Equals (===)
Strict equality compares two values for both content and type. For example, consider the following variables:
```
var numberOne= 1;
var stringOne= "1";
```
Both variables here have the same value: "1", so they are equal. However, the first variable's type is `number`, and the second variable's type is `string`.

Using strict equality means that JavaScript will not only check the value of the variables for equality but also the type of variable too. In this instance, `numberOne` and `stringOne` would not be equal even though they hold the same value.

Here are more examples showcasing strict equality using the triple equals(===) operator:
```
let score = 10
let score1 = "10"
let age = 10
let my_street = "123 Van Nuys St"
let isOpen = true
let camys_st = "123 Mission St"
 
console.log(score === score) //true
console.log(score === score1) //false, this is comparing a number and string
console.log(score === age) //true, the values are the same as well as the types, which are both numbers
console.log(my_street === my_street) //true
console.log(my_street === camys_st) //false, the two strings have different values
console.log(score === isOpen) //false, this is comparing a string to a boolean
```
## Task Instructions
Your task in this activity is to create a function called `isString` that takes three arguments (a, b, c). This function does the following:

It uses the `typeof` operator and strict equality comparison to check if the type of all three parameters `a`, `b` and `c` is `string`.
If each argument is a string it returns the message `strings`.
If any of the three parameters is not a string, then it returns the message `not` `strings`.

_Hint: Read about the typeof built-in function to help you solve the exercise._

## Task

- Given the isString function inside functions-03, make use of the typeof method to check if all passed in arguments are strings. Otherwise, return a message. For more details check out the main.js file inside functions-03.
